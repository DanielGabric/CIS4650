A JFlex+Cup implementation for the C- language.

  Note that you need to modify the classpath in the Makefile so that it
will point to the directory where "java_cup" is located.  In my own setting,
classpath is /usr/share/java/cup.jar.

To build the source code, simply type in 'make' to the terminal.
To run the compiler on source code 'example.cm', type in

    "java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main example.cm" 

but to show the abstract syntax tree type it in with the flag -a
    "java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main -a example.cm"   

To get rid of all generated files, type in 'make clean'.
